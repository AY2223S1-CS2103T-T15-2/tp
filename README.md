## Description
Class-ify is a class management application build specifically for teachers to handle all administrative related matters.

The Class-ify is an all-in-one platform to view and organize your studentsâ€™ details, and categorize them accordingly.
You can keep track of class statistics such as quiz or homework submissions, as well as view the overall progress of the class across the academic year.

## Credits
* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.

**This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).**
