## Description
Class-ify is a class management application built specifically for teachers to handle all administrative-related matters.

It is an all-in-one platform to view and organize your studentsâ€™ details, and categorize them accordingly.
You can keep track of class statistics such as quiz or homework submissions, as well as view the overall progress of the class across the academic year.
