## Project: Class-ify

Class-ify is a class management application built specially for Ministry of Education (MOE) teachers to easily monitor their studentsâ€™ academic progress.
Teachers can generate exam statistics for each class, and Class-ify quickly flags out students who require more support for contacting.

It is written in Java and the GUI is built using JavaFX.
