**Class-ify** is a class management application built specially for Ministry of Education (MOE) teachers to easily monitor their studentsâ€™ academic progress.
Teachers can generate exam statistics for each class, and Class-ify quickly flags out students who require more support for contacting.

* If you are interested in using Class-ify, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Class-ify, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
