Class-ify is a class management desktop application for teachers to **view and organize students’ details and class progress via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, and struggle with managing all your students' information, Class-ify is for you.

## FAQ

**Q**: Where can I locate my data file?  
**A**: You can locate the JSON file in the path `[JAR file location]/data/classify.json`.
We suggest that you **do not** edit the data file.
Class-ify will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run if the format of the data file is invalid.

**Q**: Why is Class-ify not running?  
**A**: Ensure Java`11` or above is installed on your computer.
