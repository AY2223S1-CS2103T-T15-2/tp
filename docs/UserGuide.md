* Exam Grades for CA1, CA2, SA1, and SA2 `exam/`
* Name of Parent `pn/`
* Mobile Number of Parent `hp/`
* Email Address of Parent `e/`

Format: `addstud nm/[STUDENT-NAME] id/[ID] class/[CLASS] exam/[NAME SCORE] pn/[PARENT-NAME] hp/[PHONE-NUMBER] e/[EMAIL]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
**Tip #1:** All **bolded** fields are compulsory. Optional fields can be added later using the [edit command](#414-editing-a-student-record--edit).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
**Tip #2:** To add exam grades, specify the tag `exam/` followed by an exam name (CA1, CA2, SA1, or SA2) and score (a number from 0 to 100). Multiple exams can be added in a single line.<br>
Example: `exam/CA1 50 exam/SA1 60 exam/CA1 80` will add grades 80 for CA1 and 60 for SA1. Notice the first score for CA1 is overridden by the second score for CA1.
</div>

Examples:
